##GasTrak

Hello! Thanks for checking out my little side project to keep my coding juices flowing.
Oh, now cut to the chase you say!

##### Gas Trak is a simple MPG calculator. Does nothing more or lessâ€” so far.

Current version does not save data and only has a single method of calculation.

Future revisions will include data visualization and Facebook integration while all running off of a RoR (Ruby on Rails) framework.

### Future Plans/Features
Integration of following features/data-to-be-tracked.

- make/model/year
 - type (SUV, Sedan, Sports)
 - engine type
- manual vs automatic
- fuel type/octane
 - fuel brand
- time of fill up
 - time between fill up
 
##### Usage

Follow the onscreen prompts to use the application.

Currently the app does not require you to fill to full, but for an accurate calculation your last fill up is required to be filled to full.

##### Suggestions/Comments

If you have any suggestions, feel free to email me at __jimmy__ _@_ __isotix__ _dot_ __com__ to contact me about any features you'd like to see.

Alternatively, you may post in the [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/jh.gastrak).

##### License

Currently I have no decided on an official license, but if you could give heads up by contacting me (I'd be excited to see where it'll be used!) and a small shout out back to me that would be much appreciated.
